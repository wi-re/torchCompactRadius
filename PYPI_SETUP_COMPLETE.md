# PyPI Source-Only Distribution Setup - Complete Solution

## Summary

Your `torchCompactRadius` package has been successfully configured to **always build from source** when installed via PyPI. This ensures compatibility with users' specific PyTorch and CUDA versions.

## What Was Changed

### 1. **pyproject.toml** - Build Dependencies
```toml
[build-system]
requires = [
    "setuptools>=61.0", 
    "wheel",
    "torch>=1.9.0",  # ‚Üê Added for build-time
    "toml"           # ‚Üê Added for dsl.py
]
build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"
```

### 2. **setup.py** - Deferred Imports
- Moved all `torch` imports inside functions
- Added graceful error handling for missing dependencies
- Added build environment information display

### 3. **Created Helper Scripts**
- `upload_to_pypi.sh` - Only uploads source distributions
- `check_environment.py` - Helps users verify build requirements
- `test_build.py` - Tests the complete PyPI simulation
- `INSTALL.md` - Installation guide
- `MANIFEST.in` - Ensures all files are included

## How It Works

When users run `pip install torchCompactRadius`:

1. **pip** reads `pyproject.toml` and installs build dependencies (`torch`, `toml`) in an isolated environment
2. **pip** downloads the source distribution (`.tar.gz`)
3. **setup.py** can now successfully import `torch` and `dsl`
4. The package builds with the user's specific PyTorch/CUDA versions
5. Installation completes with fully compatible binaries

## For PyPI Upload

```bash
# Build source distribution only
python -m build --sdist

# Upload to PyPI (source only)
twine upload dist/*.tar.gz
```

**DO NOT upload wheels** to PyPI - only upload the `.tar.gz` source distribution.

## For Your Precompiled Wheels

Continue hosting precompiled wheels on your own server for users who want faster installation:

```bash
# Users can still use your precompiled wheels
pip install torchCompactRadius -f https://your-wheel-repo.com/torch-2.5.0+cu121/
```

## Benefits

‚úÖ **Always Compatible**: Builds against user's exact PyTorch/CUDA versions  
‚úÖ **PyPI Ready**: No import issues during installation  
‚úÖ **Backward Compatible**: Existing development workflows unchanged  
‚úÖ **User Choice**: Source builds by default, wheels available via `-f`  
‚úÖ **Build Transparency**: Shows PyTorch/CUDA versions during build  

## Testing

Run the test suite to verify everything works:

```bash
python test_build.py
python check_environment.py
```

Your package is now ready for PyPI with source-only distribution! üéâ
